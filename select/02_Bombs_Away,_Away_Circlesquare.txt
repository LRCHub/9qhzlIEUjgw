All your friends will come along
Bombs away
Time machines
And other means
Faith won't go astray
And if those feelings don't belong
Bombs away
Do not fear
It's just one more year
Of tin foil to block x-rays
X 2

And the drama girls dance
It's some new kind of thing
Throwing sound waves around
Like old transmitter rings

All cut cardboard and chrome
Pulling shapes out of sky
All gone neon from grey
Lightning rods in their eyes

And the rest'll all dance
With your talk of the past
Pull the cars 'round the field
Let the hazard lights flash

Seven hundred billion
Give or take three or four
We should build a mountain of last Halloween's fireworks
And make it like this here's one

More
One more
We all live on one more
More
One more
We all live on one more
